beschweren Auch an der Wand im Zimmer, auf dem Vorhang und im Badezimmer gibt es viele Flecken, die ich die ganze Zeit ignorieren musste Ich f�hlte mich �berhaupt nicht wohl Das Personal an der Rezeption ist sehr freundlich Ich sch�tze jedoch, dass sie ihre Putzfrauen sehr schlecht bezahlen Erstens werden Sie nicht von den Putzfrauen begr��t, wenn Sie auf dem Flur auf eine treffen Was noch �rgerlicher ist, ist, dass ich um 7 Uhr morgens von den Putzfrauen aufgeweckt wurde, weil sie die T�ren so laut schlossen, als sie andere Zimmer reinigten Und sie schlossen sie nicht nur einmal laut, sondern mindestens eine Stunde lang Sie hielten die T�r offen und schlossen sie Ich war wirklich ver�rgert.

but very helpful staff and a nice place to sit with a coffee and start the day and this is the least of any worries due to their being so many good places to eat around and I personally prefer to

my barefoot We woke up to the sound of scaffolding being hammered together and someone drilling concrete Hardly the relaxing break from noisey London that I believed I had booked The pictures are of a hotel looking over a park yet the room looked over an empty courtyard scattered with random bits of scaffolding and debris The first floor corridor smelled like they were having some serious blocked plumbing issue or perhaps another guest was very unwell Their 17 breakfast is really lazily thrown together with cheap products and entirely tasteless honestly not worth it get breakfast somewhere else instead We spent 100 in 3 days on uber because this hotel is over a mile from anything and the novelty of walking around pretty canals ends 20 minutes before this hotel even comes into view They will also take 50 deposit from you in advance for every day you are planning to stay This meant on arrival I suddenly had to pay a further 150 which caused a non sterling transaction charge on my card only to have the full amount refunded when we left minus the bank charges for this pointless but menditory transaction We made the best of it but I really wish they had been open about the current

said it s no more than 2 We booked a deluxe twin room with 2 twin beds When we arrived there we got a twin room with one bed We told the front desk about this They reacted very customer unfriendly and told us there was no such thing like a twin room with two twin beds They also said that this was not their responsibility and that we should have booked from their own site and not with booking com because the information on their own site is supposedly correct We were very upset about their reaction and wanted to cancel the booking but the booking was already paid for and they said that we were free to go but they would not give our money back First they offered us to look for a room type we wanted in one of their other Park hotels When we asked them to do this they took a step back and said that they would charge us extra for this So we had to accept the room anyhow They also said that they were fully booked and there was no other room available however on every online hotel site there was the possibility to book an room on the same day More interestingly we made the booking in Euros and were charged more than 20 Euros more than our initial booking without any explanation When we were settled in the room it seemed to us the room was very cold and that the heater did not work The heater was blowing cold air even that we set it on maximum heat temperature Remarkably we discovered an electrical heating unit in the closet When we called the reception that the heater did not work they first said it was working OK and that we would have to wait to heat up That did not
